1. System Requirements
-----------------------

Apache Web Server 1.3.x or 2.x
PHP 4.1 or Greater
MySQL 4.x or Greater, OR Postgre 7.x or Greater

Certain things may break under certain versions of these software packages. If 
we find out more, we'll mention it here in future releases.

The administrative interface requires Firefox 1.5+ or Internet Explorer 5.5+, with
javascript and cookies enabled. 

	
2. New Installs
----------------

There is a convienent installation script, located at install/install.php in
this distribution. You can run this script from your web browser, and it will 
generate an .htaccess file and a config.inc.php file inside the install directory.
You should place the .htaccess file at the root of the CMS installation, and place 
config.inc.php in the include directory.

It is HIGHLY recommended that you disallow access to the installation directory
after you install. Delete the directory, or use an .htaccess with a directive like:

<Limit GET>
order deny,allow
deny from all
</Limit>


3. Upgrading from an older version
-----------------------------------

Since I run this software on production sites, I will generally try to avoid making
breaking changes to the database structure of Onnac. There is no automated 
upgrade mechanism, you must manually do it. 

Personally, I run an apache/php/mysql setup on my development workstations, and
do development/upgrades on those first before doing updates on production sites. 
I highly recommend that you do testing first before you upgrade.

3a. Version specific upgrade notes:
------------------------------------

  From    |   To      | Note
----------+-----------+-------------------------------------------------------------
0.0.8.x   | 0.0.8.5+  | Be sure to upgrade error404.html! It contains a security fix
0.0.8.x   | 0.0.8.4+  | You should add to users DB field 'description', varchar(255)
----------+-----------+-------------------------------------------------------------


3b. Recommended upgrade procedure
----------------------------------

The recommended upgrade procedure will probably go something like this. :)

a) If you are upgrading from an older Onnac to version 0.0.9.2 or above, you
will need to use the 'Import' function to import the install.osf file from 
./install/default/ directory. Make sure you only overwrite the administrative
template and interface file. and if you still have the default error pages, those too. 

If you are upgrading from Onnac 0.0.9.2 to a newer version, then you will not
need to import install.osf EXCEPT to update the default error pages.

b) Copy new distribution files over old files
	-- index.php and /include/*.php first, see if it works
	
Next, delete the following directories
	-- /include/admin/*
	-- /interface/*
	
	Then, copy the new files in /include/admin/ and /interface over
	You should NOT copy the install directory over, it is not needed.
	In general, the install directory should NOT be kept on the server.
	
In general, if it doesn't work then there are a few specific things that could have
broken:

	-- Database structure changed (see changelog)
	-- We added a new $cfg variable that you need to update your config.inc.php with

Generally, look at the changelog for details. We will try to mention any relevant 
changes there, or in this document.


4. Updating the Codepress or FCKeditor editing tools
-----------------------------------------------------

In general, we will try to keep these two tools up to date with current releases of
them. However, if you want to upgrade yourself because you're having issues, in 
general you can copy the distribution files over their respective directories at
/interface. 

FCKEditor is trickier than Codepress to upgrade. Look at the directory structure 
inside of /interface, and find the parts that match... and it should probably work. 

5. Uninstall
-------------

Delete all the files, and delete the database.
