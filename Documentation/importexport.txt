1. Exporting Data
---------------

Onnac exports data by creating an array of variables from the contents of the
database, and then uses the PHP function serialize() to create a text stream of
data and send it back to a browser. 

In the administration interface provided with Onnac, one of the menu options is
'Import/Export Site'. When you go to this page, then you will be provided with
options that will allow you to export most of the data of the database into a 
file that can later be imported back into Onnac if you desire.

2. Importing Data
---------------

Onnac can import data that was exported from the same version of Onnac. 


3. In the event of corruption
------------------------------

If you are unable to convince Onnac to import the export data into a database, 
the following script can help you recover the raw data from the export file.

<?php

	$filename = 'filename of export data.osf';
	
	$import_data = unserialize(file_get_contents($filenane));
	array_walk($import_data,'entitize');
	
	echo "<pre>";
	print_r($import_data);
	echo "</pre>";
	
	
function entitize(&$item,$key){
	$item = htmlentities($item);
}

?>

This script will serialize the data and print the contents out to the browser 
viewing the page. However, the import function should not fail unless the data
has been corrupted somehow -- in which case the unserialize function may not
recover the data either. The serialize/unserialize functions create a
representation of the php variables in a textual format, so in the event of
data corruption you can open the export file with a text editor and you may
be able to recover the information

4. Importing from other CMS
----------------------------

At this time, Onnac does not support automated importing from other Content
Management Systems.
