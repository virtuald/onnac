1.1 Export data in OSF format
------------------------------

OSF is Onnac's custom format. Onnac exports data by creating an array of variables
from the contents of the database, and then uses the PHP function serialize() 
to create a text stream of data and send it back to a browser. Look at 
include/admin/export.inc.php for more details, its pretty simplistic.

In the administration interface provided with Onnac, one of the menu options is
'Export Site Data'. When you go to this page, then you will be provided with
options that will allow you to export most of the data of the database into a 
file that can later be imported back into Onnac if you desire.


1.2 Export in HTML format
--------------------------

NEW! Onnac can now export data to HTML format. It will export it in a tar.gz file,
which you can untar to a directory and just use the static webpages. There is one
caveat however:

	- files that end in / will be named index.html if not executable and index.php
	if it is executable. If there is already a file called index.html or index.php
	then the behavior is undefined at the moment. Of course, if you have a file
	with / at the end of it, then index files are quite pointless.. :)


2. Importing Data
---------------

Onnac can import data that was exported in a format it recognizes. At the moment, the
only major incompatibilities exist in versions of Onnac prior to 0.0.9.


3. In the event of corruption
------------------------------

If you are unable to convince Onnac to import the export data into a database, 
the following script can help you recover the raw data from the export file.

<?php

	$filename = 'filename of export data.osf';
	
	$import_data = unserialize(file_get_contents($filenane));
	array_walk($import_data,'entitize');
	
	echo "<pre>";
	print_r($import_data);
	echo "</pre>";
	
	
function entitize(&$item,$key){
	$item = htmlentities($item);
}

?>

This script will serialize the data and print the contents out to the browser 
viewing the page. However, the import function should not fail unless the data
has been corrupted somehow -- in which case the unserialize function may not
recover the data either. The serialize/unserialize functions create a
representation of the php variables in a textual format, so in the event of
data corruption you can open the export file with a text editor and you may
be able to recover the information

4. Importing from other CMS
----------------------------

At this time, Onnac does not support automated importing from other Content
Management Systems.
