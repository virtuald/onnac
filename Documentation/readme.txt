1. Introduction
----------------

Onnac (Oh No! Not Another CMS) is a simplistic advanced Content Management 
System (CMS) designed for those who hand code their HTML/etc. Onnac is designed 
generically to help the advanced developer implement websites and applications 
in a (relatively) easy to manage manner.

Of course, at the moment the primary goal of Onnac is to allow me to easily 
manage the websites I administer, so expect development to occur in step with 
the ongoing requirements of active developers. If you have a useful feature 
that you think should be implemented, make a feature request or do it yourself!
If you do it yourself, then you're guaranteed that the feature will get
implemented :). Of course, if you don't like Onnac, then go use another CMS...
theres plenty of them out there. 

As of right now, there is little documentation for this software. That will
eventually change, probably. 

The administrative software uses the Codepress javascript syntax highlighter
and editor. It is released under an LGPL license, and you may find out more
information about this package at http://codepress.fermads.net/ It also uses
the FCKeditor for a WYSIWYG editing interface. It is also released under an
LGPL license, and you may obtain more information about it at 
http://www.fckeditor.net

This software is currently ALPHA software, and has not been extensively tested
in environments that I do not use! I do use it in production websites, but use
it at your own risk in any environment. 

2. Installation
----------------

For installation, see install.txt.

4. How to contribute
---------------------

If Onnac doesn't do something that you think it should be able to do, or
if you're just bored and want to write some PHP, then contact us and maybe
we can give you some good ideas. Theres still a lot of ideas I've been
meaning to implement, I've just never gotten around to doing it.
