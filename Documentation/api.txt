Onnac API Notes:
-----------------

Following is a short description of various features and ways that you can 
access information from Onnac. I will try to keep this relatively up to date.


HTML Special strings
---------------------

	##rootdir##			Root directory of CMS
	##pageroot##		Root directory of current page
	##banner##			Insert code for banner here
	##title##			Insert page title here
	##menu##			Insert menu list html here
	##db_queries##		Show number of database queries to retrieve page through db.inc.php
	##time##			Amount of time it took to render the page
	
	##content##			Only valid in (and must be specified by) templates.
						Inserts the content of the page at this spot.
						Usage in any other pages will be ignored. 

**If you call special_item_strip($item), then the item will not be escaped
in the page.

Configuration Variable: $cfg
----------------------------

To access the global variables, you must use the global $cfg variable. A short
description of some of the variables follows. 

$cfg['rootURL']			Root URL of the CMS installation
$cfg['page_root']		URL for the current page directory
$cfg['title']			Page title
$cfg['db_type']			Database type. Currently supported values are 'mysql' and 'postgres'
$cfg['db_host']			Address of the database server
$cfg['output_replace']	If true (default), then the program will replace special strings (as 
						mentioned above), otherwise it will not do so.

All dynamic php content should start with <?php and end with ?>, for maximum
compatibility do NOT use short tags ( <? ). 

Authentication Notes:
----------------------

To make authentication work, you MUST include ./include/auth.inc.php, and
run code similar to this:

	require_once("./include/auth.inc.php");
	
	// DO NOT INCLUDE THIS LINE if you are running from within the CMS!
	//$dbCon = db_connect($cfg['db_host'],$cfg['db_user'],$cfg['db_pass'],$cfg['db_name']);
	
	// permissions
	$perm_modify = "Modify site";
	$perm_view = "View pagecounts";

	global $auth;
	$auth = new authentication("$perm_modify;$perm_view");
		
	if (!$auth->loggedIn){
		$auth->authenticate();		// display the login form
		return;
	}


If the authentication class is passed a blank parameter, then it will allow
any users that are in the database to log in. Otherwise, users must be apart
of the group(s) that is specified in the parameter, or a member of the 'root'
group. Multiple groups may be specified by seperating the group names with
a semicolon. 

You can get the username by referencing $auth->username, or the user_id from 
$auth->user_id . If you need to know if a user belongs to a specific group, 
you may call $auth->verifyMembership("groupname").

In a standalone page, you must require_once ./include/auth.inc.php (remember
to alter the path accordingly!). Also, you must make a mysql connection before 
calling the constructor!
