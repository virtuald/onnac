This is a short TODO list of stuff that I am planning on implementing 
within Onnac in the near future, probably. This list isn't in any particular
order, however. Ones with *** by them means that I really should do those soon 

	-- Page caching
	-- File Browser View
		-- Directory renaming
		-- Show 'Advanced' attributes
		-- Edit file on double click, instead of 'edit' button
	-- Export parameters
		-- Time constrained
		-- Individual files
	-- "Site map" generator
		-- Google compatible XML file? 
	-- Automated dead link finder
	-- Support index.html/index.htm/index.php files
		-- Maybe remove bare directories in the future?
	-- *** Add 'preview' page support
		-- Rollback the preview
		-- Versioning support, maybe like subversion
	-- Support for existing index pages (when a physical directory exists, but files do not)
		-- need to redefine that one
	-- Possible wiki-style templates
		-- this would replace/enhance existing menus/banners
		-- this requires page caching, for sure
	-- Multiple user access
		-- This is sorta implemented, but there is no 'control' of where the user can actually
		do things. It will take some extra DB tables, I suspect
		-- Add roles
	-- Remote website sync
		-- decent import/export support is definitely key to making this happen. I want it so that on
		my local development webserver I can hit 'sync' and it will send the site out to production.
		There are a number of issues that prevent this at the moment, but it would be nice. However,
		if versioning support was implemented, then this feature would *almost* be moot. 
		
If theres something that really bugs you about Onnac, then drop me a line and if it sounds useful,
I'll do it, or at least put it on the todo list. You can always submit patches too! :)
